Each folder in the gerber directory is a complete Gerber file set for a single PCB design.

To send the Gerber files for manufacturing you should select the PCB version you want and ZIP all the files in that folder.
Eg:
  cd gerber/PCB-2023-12-14
  zip PCB-2023-12-14.zip *

Please order the board UNPOPULATED, the GERBER files do not specify the components, you need to add those manually when you 
have received the unpopulated PCBs.

These designs are made in good faith and are best efforts, but no guarantees are provided. 
Please be sure you are happy with their function and safety before using in your project.
