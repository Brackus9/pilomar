RaspberryPi based miniature observatory.
A Python3 project to control a small camera and telephoto lens housed in a miniature 3D printed observatory enclosure.
This combines multiple open modules to handle object location, tracking and image capture.

This uses Python3 on the Raspberry Pi and CircuitPython on a connected Pimoroni Tiny2040 microcontroller.

The physical telescope, mechanism and dome is buildable from the Instructables page.
